# HW04: Generative Art with p5.js
This repository contains two innovative generative art sketches created for HW04. The designs are inspired by Yayoi Kusama and Sol LeWitt, exploring randomness, geometric patterns, and the principles of rule-based art.

## Design Process
### Objective:
Create non-regular grid patterns inspired by Yayoi Kusama's art, with a focus on randomness, vibrant colors, and overlapping shapes.

### Approach:
A grid structure was created using nested for loops.
Each cell in the grid contains randomly generated shapes (circles, rectangles, and polygons) with variations in size, position, and color.
Gradient effects were added to enhance visual appeal, with a gradient function interpolating between two random colors.
A central "pumpkin-like" shape was drawn with wavy edges and overlaid with smaller dotted patterns, paying homage to Yayoi Kusama's iconic pumpkins.

### Features:
Randomized color palettes for each grid cell.
Dynamic variations in shape type, size, and position.
Interactive functionality: Clicking the canvas regenerates a new design.

### Customization:
The number of grid rows/columns and other visual properties can be easily modified by adjusting variables.
